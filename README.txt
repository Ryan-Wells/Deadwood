At initialization, you will be prompted to enter the number of players via button prompt.
After that, the game begins and you will be able to control your player using the various button prompts on the right side of the screen.
Player information and output is found in the text boxes located under the buttons.
As the game progresses, the movie cards will be removed from the board. When only one remains, the day is over. All players will be returned to the trailers and the board will be reset. Once the third day ends, the player with the highest score wins.
