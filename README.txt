~~~~~~~~~~DEADWOOD~~~~~~~~~~
Ryan Wells and Travis Breysse

Code can be compiled by running command 'make' in terminal on linux, and run through Deadwood.java
It can be run with the command: 'java Deadwood' in the terminal or by using a compiler


After the game begins, you will be prompted to enter the number of players, and then the player's names.

Once done, the first player's turn will begin and they will receive a prompt of what to do.

For instance, you can type 'move' to be given a list of possible destinations. Enter your destination (for example, 'Main Street') to move there.

Other commands exist, such as: 
'info' (prints all information about the player, and other players)
'rehearse' (if the player has a role, they receive a rehearsal token)
'upgrade' (if in the office, the player is provided with a list of upgrade options)
'cheat' (allows the player to manually set their rank, dollars, credits, rehearsal tokens, their current room, and the number of remaining scences on the board. This is used to test the game. And to cheat.)
